###Problem 6.1
Write a function that take an array A and an index i into A, and rearranges the elements such that all elements less than A[i] appear first, followed by elements equal to A[i], followed by elements greater than A[i]. Your algorithm should have O(1) space complexity and O(|A|) time complexity.

###Problem 6.3
Design an algorithm that takes a sequence of n three-dimentional coordinates to be traversed, and return the minimum battery capacity needed to complete the journey. The robot begins with a fully charged battery.

###Problem 6.4
For each of the following, A is an integer array of length n
(1) Compute the maximum value of ( A[j0] - A[i0] ) + ( A[j1] - A[i1] ), subject to i0 < j0 < i1 < j1.
(2) Compute the maximum value of ( A[j0] - A[i0] ) + ( A[j1] - A[i1] ) + ... + ( A[jk-1] - A[ik-1] ), subject to i0 < j0 < i1 < j1 < ... < jk-1 < ik-1
(3) Repeat (2) when k can be chosen to be any value from 0 to n/2

###Problem 6.6

###Problem 6.10
Given an array of n elements and a permutation TT, compute TT(A) using only constant additional storage. Use A itself to store the result.

###Problem 6.12
Given a permutation p represented as a vector, return the vector corresponding to the previous permutation of p under lexicographic ordering.

###Problem 6.13
Design a O(n) algorithm for rotating an array A of n elements to the right by i positions. You are allowed O(1) additional storage.

###Problem 6.14
Check whether a 9*9 2D array representing a partially completed Sudoku is valid. Specially, check that no row, column, and 3*3 2D subarray contains duplicates. A 0-value in the 2D array indicates that entry is blank; every other entry is in [1,9].

###Problem 6.15
Implement a function which takes a 2D array A ad prints A in spiral order.

###Problem 6.16
Implement a routine that takes a n*m Boolean array A together with an entry (x,y) and flips the color of the region assiciated with (x,y).

###Problem 6.17
Design an algorithm that rotate a n*n 2D array by 90 degrees clock-wise. Assume that n = 2^k for some positive integer k. What is the time complexity of your algorithm?

###Problem 6.18
Implement run-length encoding and decoding function. Assume the string to be encoded consists of letters of the alphabet, with no digits, and the string to be decoded is a valid encoding.

###Problem 6.19
Implement a function for reversing the words in a string. Your function should use O(1) space.

###Problem 6.20
Given two strings s(the "search" string) and t(the "text"), find the first occurrence of s in t.
