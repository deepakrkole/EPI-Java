###Problem 6.1
Write a function that take an array A and an index i into A, and rearranges the elements such that all elements less than A[i] appear first, followed by elements equal to A[i], followed by elements greater than A[i]. Your algorithm should have O(1) space complexity and O(|A|) time complexity.

###Problem 6.3
Design an algorithm that takes a sequence of n three-dimentional coordinates to be traversed, and return the minimum battery capacity needed to complete the journey. The robot begins with a fully charged battery.

###Problem 6.4
For each of the following, A is an integer array of length n
(1) Compute the maximum value of ( A[j0] - A[i0] ) + ( A[j1] - A[i1] ), subject to i0 < j0 < i1 < j1.
(2) Compute the maximum value of ( A[j0] - A[i0] ) + ( A[j1] - A[i1] ) + ... + ( A[jk-1] - A[ik-1] ), subject to i0 < j0 < i1 < j1 < ... < jk-1 < ik-1
(3) Repeat (2) when k can be chosen to be any value from 0 to n/2

###Problem 6.6
Design and implement an algorithm that takes as input an array A of n elements, and returns the beginning and ending indices of a longest increasing subarray of A.

###Problem 6.10
Given an array of n elements and a permutation TT, compute TT(A) using only constant additional storage. Use A itself to store the result.

###Problem 6.12
Given a permutation p represented as a vector, return the vector corresponding to the previous permutation of p under lexicographic ordering.

###Problem 6.13
Design a O(n) algorithm for rotating an array A of n elements to the right by i positions. You are allowed O(1) additional storage.
