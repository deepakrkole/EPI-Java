###Problem 6.1
Write a function that take an array A and an index i into A, and rearranges the elements such that all elements less than A[i] appear first, followed by elements equal to A[i], followed by elements greater than A[i]. Your algorithm should have O(1) space complexity and O(|A|) time complexity.
