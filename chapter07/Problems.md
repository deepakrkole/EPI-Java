###Problem 7.1
Write a function that takes L and F, and returns the merge of L and F. Your code should use O(1) additional storage - it should reuse the nodes from the lists provided as input.  The only field you can change in a node is next.

###Problem 7.2
Given a reference to the head of a singly linked list L, how would you determine wether L ends in a null or reaches a cycle of nodes? Write a function that returns null if there does not exist a cycle, and the reference to the start of the cycle if a cycle is present. (You do not know the length of the list in advance.)

###Problem 7.3
Write a function that takes a pointer to an arbitrary node in a sorted circular linked list, and returns the median of the linked list.
