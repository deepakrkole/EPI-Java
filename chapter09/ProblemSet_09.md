###Problem 9.1
Write a function that takes as input the root of a binary tree and returns true or false depending on whether the tree is balanced. Use O(h) additional storage, where it is the height of the tree.

###Problem 9.2 ------TODO-------

###Problem 9.3
Write a function that takes as input the root of a binary tree and returns true or false depending on whether the tree is symmetric.

###Problem 9.4 ------TODO-------

###Problem 9.5
Let T be the root of a binary tree in which nodes have an explicit parent field. Design an iterative algorithm that enumerate the nodes inorder and uses O(1) additional space. Your algorithm cannot modify the tree.

###Problem 9.6
Design an algorithm that takes a node n in a binary tree, and returns its successor, Assume that each node has a parent field; the parent field of root is null.

###Problem 9.10
Given a binary tree, write a function which forms a linked list from the leaves of the binary tree, The leaves should appear in left-to-right order.

###Problem 9.11
Write a function that prints the nodes on the exterrior of a binary tree in anti-clockwise order, i.e., print the nodes on the path from the root to the leftmost leaf in that order, then the leaves from left-to-right, then the nodes from the rightmost leaf up to the root.
